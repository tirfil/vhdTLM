# vhdTLM
Transaction Level Model (TLM) example for VHDL testing

This example is a simple testbench. The device under test is a model of a dual port RAM 8x8 bit

The methodology is based on a Jim Lewis (jim@SynthWorks.com) paper : 
"Accelerating Verification Throught Pre-Use of System-Level, Transaction-Based Restbench Components" DesignCon 2003

Transactional procedures CpuWrite() and CpuRead() enables to drive RAM address/data bus and RAM command signals using Bus Fonctional Model (BFM) components.

Transactional procedures , record structures, synchronization mechanisms are defined in a VHDL package (TEST/test_pkg.vhd)

A top level test environment (TEST/testtop.vhd) includes:
- DUT device under test (VHDL/dp8x8.vhd)
- Clock and reset processes
- BFM component to drive RAM port (TEST/bfmcpu.vhd)
- Test controller (TEST/testctrl.vhd)

The test controller architecture constains the testbench as a sequence of transactions.

The link between transactions and BFM components are bidirectionnal record type signals. 
The record type signals must be initialized at the beginning of the simulation on BFM and test controller side.

A Ready/Acknowledge mechanism is needed to synchronise the BFM and transactions. 
Ready warns the BFM of a pending transaction, Ack(nowledge) closes the current transaction.
This mechanism is implemented by two procedures:
- WaitForRequest() on BFM side
- RequestAction() on transaction side

Adding new test scenarios using this environment requests only the creation of new architectures for the test controller module.
